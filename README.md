# Statistical Simulation in R

This repository contains the code and finidngs report from several of my statistical simulation projects in R. 
The projects currently avaiilable include:
1. Gibbs Sampling for Bayesian Estimates - A comparison of the precision of parameter estimation among Gibbs sampling with an informative prior, Gibbs sampling with an uninformative prior, and frequentist methods.
2. Deck of Cards Shuffling Simulation - An investigation of the number of imperfect riffle shurffles needed to sufficiently randomize a deack of cards.
